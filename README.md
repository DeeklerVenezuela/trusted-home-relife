SuiteCRM Extensions

This project includes the creation of a property based CRM. We will be using SuiteCRM 7 or above. A sample of the current CRM is available for viewing at:

Crm.trustedhomerelief.com User ID: dev at trusted home relief dot com
Password: dev1@

We're using the standard SuiteCRM UI and just modifying the leads module. You will be able to see the basic layout of our CRM on the attachment which outlines that three tabs we need on the leads form. We are only redeveloping the CRM due to easier integrations with Free PBX, Mautic and Mailjet.

Stage 1: Basic CRM functionality
Dashboard: We need a report which shows the current properties and their disposition is. You can see from the sample CRM the way we would like it laid out. If you click on the one of the disposition totals, it will take you to a list of those Houses with that disposition. Again, see sample CRM for details.

CSV Upload: We must be able to upload a mass number of properties in CSV format. These houses will not be assigned to a user. They will automatically be dispositioned as a “Lead”. There is a plugin for this now, we will pay for the plugin.

We need this project started and completed in the next week.
